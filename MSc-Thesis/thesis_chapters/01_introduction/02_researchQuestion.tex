As SOAR is a new technology that has a lot to offer but is still untested, there are several ways to start research here. Today and in the near future, applications are increasingly being programmed as cloud-native, which means that Kubernetes will be used even more widely. At the same time, however, the risk of cyber attacks will increase. The use of SOAR tools could increase security and reduce users' security concerns.

This results in the following main research questions (HFF) with the corresponding sub-research questions (UFF):

HFF1:\\
\textit{What is the impact of integrating a SOAR tool on a Kubernetes cluster?}

UFF1.1:\\
\textit{What is the impact of implementing a SOAR tool on performance and resource performance in a Kubernetes cluster?}

UFF1.2:\\
\textit{To what extent can the introduction of a SOAR tool increase security in a Kubernetes cluster using threat detection as an example?}
