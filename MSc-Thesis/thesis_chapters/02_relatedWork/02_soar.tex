SOAR tools represent a new generation of IT security solutions designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Security Operations Centers (SOCs). These tools integrate various security technologies and automate incident response processes, reducing the manual effort required by analysts (Bridges et al., \citeyear{bridges_testing_2023}). Despite their potential, the adoption of SOAR tools remains limited, and empirical studies on their effectiveness are scarce.

Bridges et al. (\citeyear{bridges_testing_2023}) explore the challenges of testing SOAR tools in real-world environments. Their research highlights the complexity of integrating SOAR tools into existing SOC workflows and the need for standardized evaluation frameworks. The study also emphasizes the importance of configurable workflows and playbooks in streamlining incident response.

Empl et al. (\citeyear{empl_soar4iot_2022}) introduce SOAR4IoT, a framework that leverages digital twins to secure IoT assets. The authors demonstrate how SOAR tools can be adapted to address the unique security challenges of IoT environments, such as device heterogeneity and limited computational resources. This research underscores the versatility of SOAR tools and their potential to enhance security across diverse domains.
