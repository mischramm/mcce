The integration of SOAR tools with Kubernetes presents unique opportunities and challenges. Kubernetes' dynamic and distributed nature makes it an ideal platform for deploying SOAR tools, but it also introduces complexities in terms of resource management and security. Nadaf and Krishnappa (\citeyear{nadaf_kubernetes_2022}) describe Kubernetes as a platform for automating the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. Their work provides a foundation for understanding how SOAR tools can leverage Kubernetes' capabilities to enhance security.

However, the integration process is not without challenges. Bridges et al. (\citeyear{bridges_testing_2023}) note that SOAR tools must be carefully configured to avoid introducing performance bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the lack of standardized integration practices complicates the deployment of SOAR tools in Kubernetes environments.
